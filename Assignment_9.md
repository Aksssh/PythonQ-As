#### 1. What is a lambda function in Python, and how does it differ from a regular function?
A lambda function is an anonymous function (i.e., defined without a name) that can take any number of arguments but, unlike normal functions, evaluates and returns only one expression.
Unlike a normal function, we don't surround the parameters of a lambda function with parentheses.
