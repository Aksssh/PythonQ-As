    "The primary goals of Object-Oriented Programming include:\n",
    "- Robustness: Every programmer wants to produce software that produces the right output for all the anticipated inputs in the program’s application. It should be capable of handling unexpected inputs that are not explicitly defined for its application. \n",
    "- Adaptability: Modern software projects, such as word processors, web browsers, and Internet Search engines, typically involve large programs that are expected to last for many years. Therefore, software needs to evolve over time in response to changing conditions in its environment.\n",
    "- Reusability: Going hand in hand with adaptability is the desire that software is reusable, that is, code should be usable as a component of different systems in various applications. Developing quality software can be an expensive enterprise, and its cost can be offset somewhat if the software is designed in a way that makes it easily reusable in future applications. "

    "Python is an object-oriented programming language. Instead of writing code with a focus on what the computer needs to do, we focus our attention on what data we are working with and how it should interact. To do this, python breaks down data into individual pieces called \"objects\".\n",
    "Objects are variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data. The object's data can vary in type (string, integer, etc.) depending on how it’s been defined. An object is like a mini-program inside python, with its own set of rules and behaviors. \n",

   "source": [
    "##### Class attributes:\n",
    "1. Define default values: Class attributes provide a way to define default values for objects. With this, developers can create objects with pre-set values, reducing the need for manual initialization and minimizing the risk of errors.\n",
    "2. Share information among objects: They allow developers to share information among different objects. This is useful in cases where a single instance of an object needs to be shared across different parts of the codebase.\n",
    "3. Create singletons: They can be used to create singletons, which are objects that are instantiated only once and shared among different parts of the code. Again, this is particularly useful in situations where a single instance of an object needs to be shared across different parts of the codebase.\n",
    "4. Improve code organization and efficiency: They let developers create code that is more readable, understandable, and maintainable, as they provide a way to define common characteristics among objects in a clear and concise manner.\n",
    "5. Prevent unintended consequences: Python provides a way to define class methods that can be used to change class attributes without affecting all instances of a class. This is a useful technique to avoid unintended consequences when modifying class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class methods:\n",
    "1. Methods are functions that are associated with an object and can be called on that object. In OOP, methods allow objects to perform operations and interact with each other. They are defined inside classes and can take parameters, perform calculations, and modify object data.\n",
    "2. Methods provide a way to encapsulate behavior and logic into objects, making it easier to understand and maintain the code. In Python, they can be defined using the def keyword, just like any other function. However, they are associated with an object and can be called on that object using dot notation.\n",
    "3. They play a crucial role in the implementation of object-oriented programming principles and are an essential aspect of creating organized and maintainable code."
